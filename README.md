# DigiMusician

Collaboarative python project during the hack the midlands project.

## Description
Do you need somewhat goodish sounding music? Well I have the app for you!

This app generates music, displays the notes (somewhat clumsily) and then plays the beautiful tune for your listening pleasure.

Watch out for the _spooky_ easter egg!

### Our Inspiration ❤️
"I wish I found some chords in an order that is new" - Stressed Out by twenty one pilots

### Installation
In order for the program to run you must also install FluidSynth, ffmpeg and have a soundfont in the directory specified by fluidsynth (this is a bit of a hassle to sort out, sorry).
