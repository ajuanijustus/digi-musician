# DigiMusician

Collaboarative python project during the hack the midlands project.

## Pitch
Do you need somewhat goodish sounding music? Well I have the app for you!

## Description
This app generates music, displays the notes (somewhat clumsily) and then plays the beautiful tune for your listening pleasure.

Watch out for the _spooky_ easter egg!
